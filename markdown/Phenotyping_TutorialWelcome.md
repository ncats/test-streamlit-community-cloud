## NCATS-NCI-DMAP

## Welcome
Welcome to the Multiplex Analysis Web App (MAWA) presented by NCATS-NCI-DMAP. This is your one stop resource for data exploration, algorithm tuning, and figure generation. The below is a guide to using this app with suggested workflow, step-by-step instructions, and FAQs

## MAWA workflow
Based on the conversations with our working groups, the following is the intended workflow for using this application.  
1. Import Data
2. Explore Data Filters
3. Apply Phenotypes
4. Export Scatterplot
5. Export Phenotyped Data

### Phenotyping Instructions
